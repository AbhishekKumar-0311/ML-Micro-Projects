# ML Micro Projects
This repository contains the Micro Machine Learning Tasks completed during academic and self-learning period.

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- **[ML - SMS Classifier](https://github.com/AbhishekKumar-0311/ML-Micro-Projects/tree/main/ML-SMS-Classifier)**: This project classifies the SMS as spam vs non-spam through naive bayes.
	- **[ML - Telecom Churn Prediction](https://github.com/AbhishekKumar-0311/ML-Micro-Projects/tree/main/ML-Telecom-Churn-Prediction)**: This project tries to identify the main indicators of churn and predict the customers at high risk of churn through logistic regression.

	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib_

- ### Exploratory Data Analysis

	- **[EDA - World Development Indicators](https://github.com/AbhishekKumar-0311/ML-Micro-Projects/tree/main/EDA_World-Development-Indicators)**: In this project I have deployed the Plotly Dash App on Heroku, which provides UI for Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the interactions between different indicators.
	The app can be found at [Hello World App](https://hello-world-abhi.herokuapp.com/).
	
	- **[EDA - Olympics Data Analysis](https://github.com/AbhishekKumar-0311/ML-Micro-Projects/tree/main/EDA-Olympics-Data-Analysis)**: In this project I have performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find the top performing countries in Olympics.

	_Tools: Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, Dash, Matplotlib_
