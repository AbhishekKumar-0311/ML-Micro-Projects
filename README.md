# Micro Projects
This repository contains DataScience, Machine Learning, NLP, NeuralNet and RL related Micro Projects & Tasks completed/ongoing during academic and self-learning period.

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- **[ML - CO2 Emission Prediction](https://github.com/AbhishekKumar-0311/Micro-Projects/tree/main/ML-CO2-Emission-Prediction)**: This project tries to identify the  macroeconomic factors that are biggest predictors of global warming i.e. global carbon dioxide emissions using Lasso Regularization Regression.
	
	- **[ML - SMS Classifier](https://github.com/AbhishekKumar-0311/Micro-Projects/tree/main/ML-SMS-Classifier)**: This project classifies the SMS as spam vs non-spam through naive bayes.
	- **[ML - Telecom Churn Prediction](https://github.com/AbhishekKumar-0311/Micro-Projects/tree/main/ML-Telecom-Churn-Prediction)**: This project tries to identify the main indicators of churn and predict the customers at high risk of churn through logistic regression.

	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib_

- ### Exploratory Data Analysis

	- **[EDA - Australian Road Fatalities](https://github.com/AbhishekKumar-0311/Micro-Projects/tree/main/EDA-Australian-Road-Fatalities)**: I have analysed the Road Accidents data to answer questions over the Road Fatalities over years.

	- **[EDA - Global Happiness Index](https://github.com/AbhishekKumar-0311/Micro-Projects/tree/main/EDA-Global-Happiness-Index)**: I have explored, visualised, and interpreted global happiness scores over the period 2015â€”2019.

	- **[EDA - Volcanoes of the Holocene](https://github.com/AbhishekKumar-0311/Micro-Projects/tree/main/EDA-Volcanos-of-the-Holocene)**: EDA is performed to understand the volcanoes that have erupted in the last 10,000 years.

	- **[EDA - World Development Indicators](https://github.com/AbhishekKumar-0311/Micro-Projects/tree/main/EDA_World-Development-Indicators)**: In this project I have deployed the Plotly Dash App on Heroku, which provides UI for Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the interactions between different indicators.
	The app can be found at [Hello World App](https://hello-world-abhi.herokuapp.com/).
	
	- **[EDA - Olympics Data Analysis](https://github.com/AbhishekKumar-0311/Micro-Projects/tree/main/EDA-Olympics-Data-Analysis)**: In this project I have performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find the top performing countries in Olympics.

	_Tools: Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, Dash, Matplotlib, SAS, SG Procedures_
